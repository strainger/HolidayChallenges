# Independence Day Challenge
Create a _small_ number guessing game.
The program should run like this when complete

<code>  

Enter a number between 1 and 10 : 7  

That number is too high, guess again: 5  

That number is too low, guess again: 6  

CORRECT! 6 was the number  

</code>  

feel free to add things such as number validation, attempt limits, etc. 

Have fun!
