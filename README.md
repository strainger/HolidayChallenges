# HolidayChallenges
Source code for programming challenges that are posted on US holidays.
# But Why?
I live apart from my family so for most holidays I don't have much to do, so I decided to create a programming challenge to complete on every holiday!
# Sir, how do I contribute?
Every holiday challenge will be contained in the folder structure  

_~/year/holiday/_

Within that folder, there will be the actual challene in the file  

_CHALLENGE.md_

the other item in that folder will be a folder titled **entries**  
_Simply_ upload your source code there, make sure that each entry is only 1 file in size.
**TITLE** the file your_username-challenge.extension
 Commenting your code isn't needed but may help others see what you did and why.
  
Thanks
